# 3D Reconstruction of a Prickly Pear Using Structure from Motion with COLMAP

Prickle pear production in Mexico yields an annual
performance of 400 tons. However, current production practices
require significant manual effort and time, highlighting the need
for innovation in line with the new technological paradigm.
Generating 3D models of prickle pear could facilitate future
projects such as analysis, robotic simulations, machine design
or data acquisition. Thus, this repository has 
a group of 3D prickle pear models  un mesh format using the COLMAP software
with structure from motion techniques. All the elements used during the 3D reconstruction pipeline are explained in the next figure.
